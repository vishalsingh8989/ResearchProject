Extractive text summarization
Extractive text summarization involves the selection of phrases and sentences from the source document to make up the 
new summary. Techniques involve ranking the relevance of phrases in order to choose only those most relevant to the 
meaning of the source.
==========================================================================================================================

==========================================================================================================================
Abstractive text summarization
Abstractive text summarization involves generating entirely new phrases and sentences to capture the meaning of the 
source document. This is a more challenging approach, but is also the approach ultimately used by humans. Classical 
methods operate by selecting and compressing content from the source document.
1. STRUCTURED BASED APPROACHS :  
  1.1 Tree based methods
  1.2 Template based methods
  1.3 Ontology based methods

Deep learning
The results of deep learning methods are not yet state-of-the-art compared to extractive methods, yet impressive 
results have been achieved on constrained problems such as generating headlines for news articles that rival or 
out-perform other abstractive methods.The promise of the approach is that the models can be trained end-to-end without 
specialized data preparation or submodels and that the models are entirely data-driven, without the preparation of 
specialized vocabulary or expertly pre-processed source documents.

Abstractive text summarization
Summarizations using abstractive techniques are broadly classified into two categories: Structured based approach
and Semantic based approach
1. STRUCTURED BASED APPROACHS :  
  1.1 Tree based methods
  1.2 Template based methods
  1.3 Ontology based methods
  1.4 Lead and Body Phrase Method
  1.5 Rule Based Method
2  SEMANTIC BASED APPROACHES
  2.1 Multimodal semantic model
  2.2 Information Item Based Method
  2.3 Semantic Graph Based Method
